# SWEN30006 Software Modelling and Design - Assignment 3

We are tasked with designing an *AI Controller* to control a car
through an unseen map. Our design is required to be able to avoid and
potentially traverse various traps, as well as detect and manoeuvre dead
ends. The goal is for the car to reach the exit safely and quickly.
